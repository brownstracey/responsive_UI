## Overview

Campus Life Planner helps you stay organized with four main sections:

- **Records** â€” store title, due date, duration, and tag information.  
- **To-Do List** â€” manage and prioritize tasks visually.  
- **Notifications** â€” view important updates and reminders.  
- **Settings** â€” toggle themes, manage your profile, privacy, or account.  

Every action updates in real time and is not affected by reloading your browser.

## Regex Catalog

This app uses regular expressions (regex) to validate and search user inputs consistently.  
Below is the full catalog of expressions used across records, filters, and validation modules.

| Purpose | Pattern | Example / Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Title / Description** | `/^\S(?:.*\S)?$/` | Forbids leading/trailing spaces and collapses double spaces. |
| **Numeric Field** (amount, duration, pages) | `/^(0|[1-9]\d*)(\.\d{1,2})?$/` | Accepts integers or decimals with up to two places. |
| **Date (YYYY-MM-DD)** | `/^\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])$/` | Strictly validates ISO-like dates. |
| **Category / Tag** | `/^[A-Za-z]+(?:[ -][A-Za-z]+)*$/` | Allows letters, spaces, or hyphens only. |
| **Tag Filter** | `/^@tag:(\w+)/i` | Detects filters like `@tag:hw`. |
| **Time Token** | `/\b\d{2}:\d{2}\b/` | Detects times like `09:30` or `17:45`. |
| **Duration** | `/\d+[mh]?/gi` | Matches durations like `45m`, `2h`, or `90`. |
| **Mention** | `/@\w+/g` | Detects mentions like `@profsmith`. |
| **Hashtag** | `/#\w+/g` | Matches hashtags like `#study`. |
| **Advanced Patterns (examples)** | `/\b(\w+)\s+\1\b/` and `/(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}/` | Catch duplicate words (`"word word"`) or check password strength. |
